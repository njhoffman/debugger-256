Implement environment variable overrides for output similar to debug module (takes precedence over other configuration).
Coniditional output for each message based on filtering level,  i.e. if displaying user accounts:
  info('Users', _.map(users, 'email'), { filterMax: 5 })
  trace('Users', users);
  -- this would only output the info message if trace levels were not being logged
Multiple colorKey and filterKey, should it be done?
